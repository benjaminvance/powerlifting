        Powerlifting is made up of three main lifts. Those lifts are the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmjr4Q6je8I&t=195s">
          bench press </a
        >,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa0Y9y5ZAo4&t=203s"
          >deadlift</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Plfzis9R0&t=622s">squat</a>.
        The total of those three lifts are added together to get your total. On
        a meet day the competitor will have three attempts at the three main
        lifts. The competitor's total will be put up against people in the same
        weight class. Many beginners will see the most progress by cutting
        weight to put themself into the proper weight class rather than trying
        to immediately get stronger.

    <p>
      There are simple rules to follow with each of these three lifts. Each set
      of rules is dependant on the federation hosting the competition. The usual
      rules are that when squating, you must go deep enough that your hip crease
      goes below the knee. When bench pressing your feet must stay planted on
      the floor, your butt, shoulders and head must stay in contact with the
      bench and the barbell must touch your chest and fully go back up. The
      deadlift is most simple, the lifter must lift the weight and fully lock
      out and the bar can not start to go back down.

    <h2>Why Your Current Workout Plan Is Not Working</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Programming</li>
      <li>Diet</li>
      <li>Sleep</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When someone is going to the gym everyday and
      <span class="boldtext">not seeing results</span> it is usually because of
      one of these three reasons. You can be working out enough and dieting
      right, but if you're barely sleeping at night your muscles won't have time
      to recover. You can also be working out right and sleeping plenty but if
      you're not eating enough protein that your body needs you won't see the
      results you want.
    </p>

    <h2>Beginner Powerlifting Programs</h2>

    <p>
      There are <span class=" boldtext italictext">endless</span> powerlifting
      programs out there. The main thing to remember when looking for a new
      powerlifting program is that there is no
      <span class="italictext">magic program</span>. There isn't a magic number
      of sets that will get you stronger faster. It all goes back to the basics
      of lifting heavy and recovering to get stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I would recommend a push, pull legs routine or a simple 5x5
      routine to a beginner. The most important thing for a new lifter to focus
      on is form and discipline. Form sets a good foundation and will keep the
      lifter from getting hurt. Discipline will show you that you are capable of
      eating healthy and meal prepping and going to the gym everyday.
