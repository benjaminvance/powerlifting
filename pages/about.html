      Powerlifting Basics is your online resource for getting into powerlifting,
      or to learn to more if you are already in the sport. On our
      <a href="/VanceBenjaminHomePage.html">Home Page</a>
      we talk more about the three main lifts that make up powerlifting. The
      current website is under construction but will soon have more pages,
      including the basics of programming, nutrition and myths and facts about
      powerlifting! Please check back frequently for updates.
