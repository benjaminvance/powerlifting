    <p>
      As you can see here this lifter would max out at a 300 pound bench, 400
      pound squat and 500 pound deadlift. This would equal a very nice 1200
      total and mean that the lifter was very well balanced. While some people
      will be naturally stronger in some areas, it is important to figure out
      what your weaknesses are so you can focus on them more.
